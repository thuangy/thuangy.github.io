	<h1>My Flash Animations</h1>
	<p>I started animating on a whim. In high school, my friend encouraged me to join a video and broadcasting club. The very first meeting, the faculty advisor gauged our interests in learning various skills, from directing to camera-work to animating. Watching anime was one of my hobbies, so naturally I wrote animation down as one of the areas I wished to explore. That day, the teacher gave another student and I a crash course in Flash 8. As the other student and I played around with making a ball bounce around the screen, I fell in love with the process of modifying tiny technical details to make a sweeping creative work with a big impact. The other kid clearly did not, though, as I never saw him again. However, I became the club's 'animator' of sorts, and was entrusted with creating the club's intro videos for its various shows. In addition, whenever I had to complete a school project that offered even a little bit of room for creativity, I would always turn to animation, a medium that I felt increasingly confident and proud of.</p>
